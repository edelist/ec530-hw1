# GPS Matcher

A Python project to calculate distances between geographical coordinates and match points in one set to their closest counterparts in another set using the Haversine formula. This project includes a `match_closest_points` function, automated tests, and integration with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Features

- **Haversine Distance Calculation**: Compute the great-circle distance between two latitude/longitude points.
- **Closest Point Matching**: Match each point in a set to the closest point in another set based on GPS coordinates.
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure functionality and reliability with `unittest`.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated testing on every push or pull request.
